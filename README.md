## Lab01

- Install python interpreter on your machine.
- Write a program that counts up the number of vowels [a, e, i, o,
u] contained in the string.
- Fill an array of 5 elements from the user, Sort it in descending
and ascending orders then display the output.
- Write a program that prints the number of times the string 'iti'
occurs in anystring.
- Write a program that remove all vowels from the input word and
generate a brief version of it.
- Write a program that prints the locations of "i" character in any
string you added.
- Write a program that generate a multiplication table from 1 to the
number passed.

## Lab02

- Write a function that accepts two arguments (length, start) to
generate an array of a specific length filled with integer numbers
increased by one from start.
- write a function that takes a number as an argument and if the
number divisible by 3 return "Fizz" and if it is divisible by 5 return
"buzz" and if is is divisible by both return "FizzBuzz"
- Write a function which has an input of a string from user then it
will return the same string reversed.
- Ask the user for his name then confirm that he has entered his
name(not an empty string/integers). then proceed to ask him for
his email and print all this data (Bonus) check if it is a valid email
or not

- Write a function that takes a string and prints the
longest alphabetical ordered substring occurred For example, if
the string is 'abdulrahman' then the output is: Longest substring in
alphabetical order is: abdu

- Write a program which repeatedly reads numbers until the user
enters “done”.
Once “done” is entered, print out the total, count, and
average of the numbers.
If the user enters anything other than a number, detect their
mistake, print an error message and skip to the next number.

- Word guessing game (hangman)
  - A list of words will be hardcoded in your program, out of
      which the interpreter will
  - choose 1 random word.

  - The user first must input their names

  - Ask the user to guess any alphabet. If the random word
  contains that alphabet, it

  - will be shown as the output(with correct placement)

  - Else the program will ask you to guess another alphabet.

  - Give 7 turns maximum to guess the complete word
